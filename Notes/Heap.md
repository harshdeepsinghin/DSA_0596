## What is a Heap?
> A heap is a nearly complete binary tree with the following two properties:
- Structural property:
	- All levels are full, except possibly the last one, which is filled from left to right.
- Order (heap) property:
	- for any node x, Parent(x) >= x. 

- The elements in the subarray are leaves.
- There are two types of heaps:
	1. Max heap:
		- Largest element is at the root.
	2. Min heap:
		- Smallest element is at the root.
- Since heap is ordered (sorted) structure, therefore the insertion and deletion will be done from the bottom (left to right) and (right to left) respectively.
