> A tree is recursively defined as a set of one or more nodes where one node is designated as the  
root of the tree and all the remaining nodes can be partitioned into non-empty sets each of which is a sub-tree of the root.

- Non-Linear Data Structure
- **Root** is the first node that does not have any parent node.
- **Leaf nodes** are the nodes that do not have further children.
- **Ancestor node** is the previous node and the Descendant node is the next node of a node.
- **Degree** of a node means the number of children a node have.
- **Depth** of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.  
- **Height of a node** is the number of edges from the deepest leaf to that the node.
	- Height of a tree is the height of the root which also equal to the maximum number of edges from root to the deepest leaf.
- A full binary tree.is a binary tree in which each node has exactly zero or two children.
- A complete binary tree is a binary tree, which is completely filled.

## Binary Tree
> A tree in which each node can have 2 children nodes at most.
